## User Story
User Story: Admin views inventory after signing in
This test tells a complete story:
1. User starts signed out
2. User signs in
3. User views inventory with data loaded
Each step has both programmatic and visual verification.

## Test Steps
### STEP 1: Navigate to inventory page (signed out)
<!-- Add screenshot here if available -->

### STEP 2: Sign in to application
<!-- Add screenshot here if available -->

### STEP 3: Wait for inventory data and authenticated content to load
<!-- Add screenshot here if available -->

## Verification
This test verifies the workflow through both programmatic assertions (checking visibility, text content) and visual regression testing (screenshots).
