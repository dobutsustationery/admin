**Spec File**: [`008-subtypes.spec.ts`](./008-subtypes.spec.ts)

## User Story
User Story: Admin views items with subtypes

2. User signs in
3. User views the subtypes page with item categorization
Each step has both programmatic and visual verification.

## Test Steps

<!-- Add screenshot here if available -->

### STEP 2: Sign in to application
<!-- Add screenshot here if available -->

### STEP 3: Wait for subtypes page to load
<!-- Add screenshot here if available -->

## Verification
This test verifies the workflow through both programmatic assertions (checking visibility, text content) and visual regression testing (screenshots).
